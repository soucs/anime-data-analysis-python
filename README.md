# Anime Data Analysis in Python using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Just started Learning

Most of you might already be familiar with animes, especially those Japanese ones that are just so addictive. These shows, which are similar to cartoons, have a huge number of viewers and fans. Hundreds of animes are being released each year in all possible genres. 
<br>
The dataset I'm going to use here was originally scraped from the site www.myanimelist.net, which is an online anime and manga community and database, where viewers can post reviews, rate animes, etc (similar to Goodreads which is for books).
<br>
This dataset contains information on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime. We're going to use this data and explore what meaningful conclusions we can derive from it.
